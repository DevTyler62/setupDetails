                            <p>The Logitech MX Master 2s is apart of the egonomic side of Logitech products.
                                This version of the mouse is actually not the newest version they currently sell
                                which is the MX Master 3. I will say that this is the best mouse that I have used so
                                far.
                                It feels really nice to use and fits my hand well. The inifte scroll wheel is also very
                                nice
                                especially when you are in build code files or on long websites so you can scoll to the
                                spot you are
                                searching for much faster.

                            <p>The Drop alt Mechanical keyboard is actually my third keyboard I have owned.
                                Out of the three that I have used this is definitely the best one so far. This is my
                                first smaller board being a 65%. It has all the jeys that I need especially the arrow
                                keys.
                                I am using Kailh Box White switchs for my board as well as some Razer white PBT keycaps
                                for
                                my character keys. Overall this keyboard feels really nice to me and gets me excited to
                                type on it.

                            <p>My laptop that I use to get my work done is an HP Envy X360. I got it back in 2017.
                                The only spec I know is that it has an Intel-i7 processor in it. It runs things well
                                when it
                                is at its best but it does seem to be showing its age now. I can barley get an hour when
                                I'm off charge.
                                Plus HP said they will no longer be supporting this laptop as well. I am looking to
                                switch to a new MacBook
                                Pro sometime here in the near future to continue my quest in web development.

                            <p>This is the best purchase I have made for my setup yet. This monitor is great for
                                productivity.
                                I can have three windows rather comfortably on screen. This allows me to have code on
                                one window, the application
                                on another, and then some documentation or other readings on the last page. Not having
                                to bounce back and forth
                                between windows everytime is very nice. It also helps with my school work as well
                                allowing me to follow along in the
                                lectures and take notes in the other window just beside it. I would definitely recommend
                                this monitor to anyone.

                            <p>My Ipad comes in handy when I want to draw out ideas and wrtie over top of documents.
                                This plus the Apple pencil make it so easy to highlight important notes for exams or

                                right next to the question without having to write the question down on paper. It also
                                benefits when your
                                in a meeting or lecture and instead of trying to write down everything that is being
                                said you just need to jot down the
                                important ideas that are not on the slides being presented.

                            <p>The headpones I use are the AirPods Pro. I have had the orginal AirPods which worked
                                great but I wanted
                                some noise cancallation. These definitely do get rid of some of the outside noise. Its's
                                nice to be able to just
                                listen to my music and do work while others in the area can be amking noise but it does
                                not distract me.
                                The noise cancallation is for sure not over the ear headphone quality but it gets the
                                job done. In the future I do
                                plan on looking into the Sony WH-1000MX4's since they are the king of noise
                                cancallation.
