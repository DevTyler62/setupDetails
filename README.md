# setupDetails

This is a project built using the Materialize CSS library. It involves using a few of the componets from the library to build out a way for people
following my instagram page to quickly access what I use each day to complete my work. I give some details as to how each product fits into my work
as well as then a link to the products page where the user can either purchase it themselves or get more details on that product.
